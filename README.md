Exercise #4: Network Simulations using NS2

 



Title
Lab exercise: Network Simulations using NS2

Objective
1) Simulate different network types using NS2

2) Simple performance analysis

Pre-requisites
TCL

Description
Simulate the following network in NS2. Sender 1 and Sender 2 send data through the Router to the Receiver, which acts as the sink.

Link Properties:Bandwidth: 10MbpsPropagation delay: 10msQueuing method: drop-tailTraffic Pattern for Sender1 & Sender2:
TCP sourcePacket size: 512 bytesCongestion window: 1000 pktsAdvertised window: 1000 pkts


Run the simulation for 60 seconds. Plot the throughput obtained by different flows along the Router-Receiver link.
Repeat the same experiment with different properties of source and sink nodes, and record your observations.
Repeat the same experiment with UDP sources, and record your observation. In this case, you should trace the number of packets lost also.


What to present
Show the various experiments performed and their observations
